[Did ChatGPT Write This Article?](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/did-chatgpt-write-article)

This article is interesting because it delves into the possiblity of what AI can accomplish, especially with the introduction of ChatGPT. Although it isn't perfect, ChatGPT is a huge leap forward on what AI can do. Both students and teachers can use this technology to create a better learning environment for each other. The drawbacks, however, are still present in this technology. It is biased based on its human operater, and will not be 100% accurate, especially if not given enough context on the task its given. Despite that, it is clear that the evolution of this technology will have an impact on our future.


I found the quote in the article, "Any suggestion that machines are thinking, or becoming human-like, should be avoided" (Barba) interesting as it often seems that the mainstream public impression of AI and Machine Learning is that computers think for themselves, when in reality these computers are still following algorithms that are designed to mimic human behavior. At the end of the day, computers are still performing a programmable, algorithmic task. I like how Lorena Barba clarifies what exactly these computers are doing, as it should help to quell any notion of fear or concern that machines will take over and become sentient beings on their own through AI. - Kevin Gong (kxg202)
